### Custom and Library Provided
Write custom functions and utilize Rust's standard library to enhance your programs.

### Organizing your Code
Structure your Rust projects using modules and packages for better code organization and reusability.

### Testing
Learn to write tests in Rust and adopt test-driven development (TDD) practices to ensure your code works as expected.

## Intermediate Level

### Flexibility and Abstraction with Generics
Use generics to write flexible and reusable code that can handle different data types.

### Functional Programming Aspects
Explore Rust's functional programming features, including closures, iterators, and higher-order functions.

### Memory Management Features
Dive deeper into Rust's memory management with smart pointers and reference counting.

### Implementing Typical Data Structures
Implement common data structures like linked lists and hash maps in Rust.

### Useful Patterns for Handling Structs
Learn best practices and patterns for working with structs in Rust.

## Advanced Level

### Understanding Size in Rust
Understand memory size considerations and optimizations in Rust.

### Concurrency
Write concurrent code using threads, async/await, and channels to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

### Macros
Leverage Rust's powerful macro system for metaprogramming and code generation.
